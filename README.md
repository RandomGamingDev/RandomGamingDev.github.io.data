Hello! Welcome to my new website! Here you'll be able to check out some featured projects and my blog! All the source code is licensed under the MIT license so you can also use this format if you want :).</br>

Here's the link to the website: https://randomgamingdev.github.io/index.html </br>

Now, you might wonder how my website is updating all of these articles and stuff while the website is static, and without any connections to, for example, an SQL database, well, I didn't exactly want to manage a database, so what I opted for instead, was a solution where all the config files are stored on another website (in this case it's https://github.com/RandomGamingDev/RandomGamingDev.github.io.data), which points to other locations, allowing for an easy to use, dynamic, and free solution!
