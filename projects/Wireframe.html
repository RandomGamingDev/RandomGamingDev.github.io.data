  The Wireframe game engine's a powerful, yet simple no GUI, 0-cost game engine designed in C++.</br>
  The goal for the engine is to eventually be able to support more and more APIs, libraries, and more, in a simple way</br>
  Imagine an engine, controlled by the community, that gives power to the developer, is simple enough for a large part of the developer community to understand.</br>
  Plus, being able to support multiple different platforms and their many different features due to its flexibility</br>
